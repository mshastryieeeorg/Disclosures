This repository will have public facing documents that show developments, initiatives and efforts. You are welcome to imitate these documents and contents therein fearlessly, with no repraisals. These artefacts took me three years to develop, just understanding common references has been a great task, then learning how to make money from the sweat equity.

## Company Statement

[Kalman | Systems+ Company Disclosure](https://github.com/mshastryieeeorg/disclosure/blob/main/Kalman%20Systems%20Company%20Disclosure.pdf)

# Capabilities and Audience?

Kalman Systems provides practical, high-value solutions with a flexible contracting model that emphasises agility, efficiency, and technology driven decision making. We specialise in providing solutions and support in advanced computing, engineering consulting, and business strategy services. We focus on many profitable domains, ensuring pragmatic engagement with one another. Half of our work relates to technical consulting and the remaining relates to business monetisation.

At Kalman Systems, we are model-agnostic, ensuring a practical, tailored response to challenges. Our services span related and broader industries, and we acknowledge when we do not understand something. You may notice that we do not promote tools or frameworks in isolation, nor do we become unsettled by their use. Progenitors of solutions may emerge from irrelevant or irreverent beginnings; our aim is to provide you with a home, not to indoctrinate you on the selection of bricks.

# Modelling Concept

While there are numerous and may be endless modelling representation, I found Dr.Hürilmann addressed it in his recent book edition, in an easy manner. This depiction is actually how systems are developed.
